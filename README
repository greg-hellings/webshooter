You need Qt4, PyQt4 and the QtWebKit module installed to run this program.

It accepts either a list of files or standard input and assumes one domain
name per line of code.  It does not currently support pages other than the
home page, as the extra '/' characters in the URL will mess things up.  Only
place names like 'www.google.com' on a line, as the program will automatically
prepend an 'http://' to the URL.

Screenshots will be stored in images/ when you run the program, and they will
wantonly and silently overwrite any existing images.  If you want to keep
images from a previous run, make sure you pull them out of that directory.

Currently, if one of the sites returns an error code like 500 or what have you,
then the program will hang after that entry.  I haven't yet figured out why
this is.
